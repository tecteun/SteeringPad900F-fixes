UPDATING THE FIRMWARE

Your controller is already running as a controller
with a previous version!

- Copy the content in the Arduino folder to the Arduino folder in your Documents location
- Open your previous version script and COPY THE THRESHOLSD variable.
  It should look like this:

const int thresholds[7] = 
{
  236, // button 3
  395, // button 5
  493, // button 6
  178, // buttons 3 & 5
  193, // buttons 3 & 6
  284, // buttons 5 & 6
  153  // buttons 3 & 5 & 6
};

- Close that script and open the newest version.
- Locate the thresholds in the CONSTANT VARIABLES section (line 171 to 180).
- Replace with the copy from the last script.

- In the controller, open the menu by long pressing the T button
- In the Arduino IDE, select the Arduino Micro COM x (it's always different)
- Make sure you don't have another ProMicro connected - You might write the code into the wrong one!
- Upload the code (Ctrl + U).

Once done, the controller displays the main screen with the new version number at the bottom left.
At this point, is ready to use
